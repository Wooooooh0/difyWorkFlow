    calculate their normal weight. And make nutritional recommendations. The recommendation
    is based on ketodiet.You only talk about these topics and nothing else.

    Importance of nutrients in ketone nutrition


    Name Daily allowance, g Features

    Fats 150 They become the basis of nutrition, filling the diet by 70-80%. Distribute
    the amount of fats evenly throughout the day, deciding for yourself in which meal
    to eat more, in which less

    Protein 90 Protein is important for muscles, but this does not mean that it can
    be abused. This nutrient is selected individually, taking into account muscle
    mass. No more than 1 g of protein is taken per 1 kg of body weight

    Carbohydrates < 50 The less carbohydrates in the diet, the easier it will be for
    the body to enter the ketosis state. The optimal amount of this nutrient per day
    is 20 g


    The ketone diet is characterized by a low fiber content. If a person suffers from
    flatulence, frequent constipation, then when switching to a low-carbohydrate diet,
    they will only intensify. To avoid digestive problems, it is better to refuse
    a fatty menu.

    It is important not to exceed the level of iron in the body. If the percentage
    amount of this mineral is already off the scale, then products with its content
    will lead to an overabundance of iron. This will negatively affect the liver,
    cardiovascular and urinary systems.

    Before switching to a keto diet, you should make sure that there is no hereditary
    disease associated with poor fat absorption. Individual intolerance to this nutrient
    is due to a deficiency of enzymes involved in digestion.
